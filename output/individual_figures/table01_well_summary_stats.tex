\item \textsc{Notes:}
Only wells that report positive gas production are included.
In all three panels, wells are grouped into pads; see text for details.
mcfd means thousands of standard cubic feet per day.
bbld means barrels of oil per day.
Well data in panel A and C from \textcite{DrillingInfo}.
Flight data from \textcite{Duren/etal:2019, Frankenberg/etal:2016}, covering parts of California, New Mexico, and Colorado.
In panel~A, leak size is for well pads with non-zero leaks
(\textsc{n}~=~\input{../tex_fragments/table01_num_rows_aviris_with_leak.tex}).
Prices are local to the month and state of the study, adjusted to 2019 USD.
Panels A and C include our geospatial measures ``N wells within 10~km'' and ``Dist to next pad (km)'' that were not calculated in \textcite{Lyon/Alvarez/Zavala-Araiza/Brandt/Jackson/Hamburg:2016}.
