Points show the reduction from the in \gls{DWL} and emissions from the no-policy case.
\gls{DWL} is in the upper panel, emissions the lower.
Policies are visually paired by what information is available to the regulator.
Points are posterior means; error bars are 95\% \gls{CI}.
See discussion of results in section~\ref{sec:dwl-and-emissions}.
The tabular version of this figure, and a version with a cardinal x-axis, can be found in appendix~\ref{app:tabular-policy-output}.
