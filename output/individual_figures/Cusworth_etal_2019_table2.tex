\item \textsc{Note:} Table is a subset of \textcite{Cusworth/Jacob/Varon/Miller/Liu/Chance/Thorpe/Duren/Miller/Thompson/Frankenberg/Guanter/Randles:2019} table~2 (CC BY 4.0).
Results simulate methane retrievals from the EnMAP satellite, expected to launch in 2021.
Values in parentheses are standard deviations from five iterations.
We exclude the paper's results for images with ``dark'' or ``urban'' backgrounds, as these include water and confuse the image processing algorithm.
In personal communication, the lead author notes ``one could dramatically improve the prediction if there were some sort of decision tree that was based on the underlying surface.''
