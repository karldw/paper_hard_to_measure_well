\textsc{Note:}
Values are the expected fee per kg emitted, as a percentage of the social cost of emissions (100 \(T \tau r_i / \delta H\)).
Panels A, B, and C set \(T = \) 1 week and consider different values of \(\tau\).
Each row considers different audit rules to optimally allocate \(r_i\) according to the fixed audit budget, which is set to 10\% of all well pads.
Columns provide distributional statistics across well pads.
\(\delta = \) \$2 per kg methane.


Wells in this table are the sample of wells included in the \gls{AVIRIS-NG} sample (table~\ref{tab:well-summary-stats} panel~\textsc{a}).
Point estimates and square brackets indicate the mean and 95\% \gls{CI}.
(See text for \gls{CI} details.)
