Box plots show the distribution across wells of expected fees.
In the box plot, the point is the median well, the box is the 25th to 75th percentile, and the whiskers are the 1st to 99th percentile.
Each value is the posterior mean across \gls{MCMC} draws.
The upper and lower panels have different y-axis scales.
See discussion of results in section~\ref{sec:audit-probabilities-and-expected-fees}.
